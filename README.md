# 🌌 Fractal Art Studio — *Click-to-Paint Edition*
### 🎨 Create Infinite Art Using Mathematical Fractals

---

## 🖋 Overview

**Fractal Art Studio** is an interactive generative-art application built in **Python (Tkinter)**.

Instead of generating a single static fractal, this project gives you a **free-style click-to-paint system**:

- Select a **fractal type**
- Adjust **depth**, **size**, and **color**
- Click anywhere on the canvas to grow a fractal at that point

You can create:

- 🌳 Recursive trees  
- ❄ Koch snowflakes  
- 🌀 Spiral galaxies  
- 🌿 Fern-like structures  

Perfect for:

- Learning recursion & fractal geometry  
- Computer graphics & Python GUI projects  
- Creative coding & generative art  
- College / portfolio demos

## ✨ Features

- 🖱 **Click-to-paint** fractals anywhere on the canvas  
- 🌳 **Four fractal types**:
  - Recursive Tree  
  - Spiral Fractal  
  - Koch Snowflake  
  - Fern Fractal  
- 🎛 **Custom controls**:
  - Depth (recursion level)  
  - Size (scale of the fractal)  
- 🌈 **Color palette buttons** to instantly change style  
- 🧽 **Clear Canvas** button to reset and start fresh  
- ⚡ Built using **pure Python + Tkinter** (no external dependencies required)

## 🧠 Fractals Included

| Fractal Type | Description | Visual Style |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| 🌳 **Recursive Tree** | Binary branching recursion | Nature-like tree structures |
| ❄ **Koch Snowflake** | Classic fractal curve substitution | Snowflake crystals |
| 🌀 **Spiral Fractal** | Recursive shrinking spiral arcs | Galaxy / vortex appearance |
| 🌿 **Fern Fractal** | Stem + side leaves using recursion | Organic leaf / fern patterns |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Tkinter** (comes bundled with most Python installations)

> 💡 *No additional libraries are required to run the base app.*  
> Optional for future PNG export support:
```bash
pip install pillow
```
## 🎮 Controls & Usage
### 🎨 Select Fractal Type

Use the dropdown menu to choose:

Tree
Spiral
Koch Snowflake
Fern

### 🔁 Adjust Depth

Higher depth → more detail & complexity
Lower depth → simpler shapes, faster drawing

### 🔍 Adjust Size

Controls how large each fractal grows from the click point

🌈 Pick a Color
Click a colored button to instantly apply that color to fractals
🖱 Draw Fractals
Click anywhere on the black canvas
Your selected fractal grows from that position
🧽 Clear Canvas
Press Clear Canvas to wipe everything and start fresh
